This repository is for publishing the scripts used in the following paper.
Genetic basis and functional architectures underlying athletic performance revealed by integrative analysis of GWAS-associated SNPs


## Paper Information


## Directory structure
- `SNP_enrichment_regioneR` : Directory for analyzing enrichment in gene regions based on SNP position information using regioneR
- `Calc_Zscore_regioneReloaded` : Directory for calculating local Z-scores for gene regions based on SNP positions using regioneReloaded

Each folder contains the information required for environment setup, analysis scripts, and example input files for the scripts.

Although the environment is mostly the same, we recommend building the environment for each analysis just to be safe.
Environment setup uses [renv](https://github.com/rstudio/renv). Environments can be restored from lock files in each folder. Additionally, information about R, Bioconductor, and installed packages required for manual setup is also stored.
